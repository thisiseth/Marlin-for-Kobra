/**
 * A servo is activated by creating an instance of the Servo class passing the desired pin to the attach() method.
 * The servos are pulsed in the background using the value most recently written using the write() method
 *
 * Note that analogWrite of PWM on pins associated with the timer are disabled when the first servo is attached.
 * Timers are seized as needed in groups of 12 servos - 24 servos use two timers, 48 servos will use four.
 *
 * The methods are:
 *
 * Servo - Class for manipulating servo motors connected to Arduino pins.
 *
 * attach(pin)           - Attach a servo motor to an i/o pin.
 * attach(pin, min, max) - Attach to a pin, setting min and max values in microseconds
 *                         Default min is 544, max is 2400
 *
 * write()               - Set the servo angle in degrees. (Invalid angles —over MIN_PULSE_WIDTH— are treated as µs.)
 * writeMicroseconds()   - Set the servo pulse width in microseconds.
 * move(pin, angle)      - Sequence of attach(pin), write(angle), safe_delay(servo_delay[servoIndex]).
 *                         With DEACTIVATE_SERVOS_AFTER_MOVE it detaches after servo_delay[servoIndex].
 * read()                - Get the last-written servo pulse width as an angle between 0 and 180.
 * readMicroseconds()    - Get the last-written servo pulse width in microseconds.
 * attached()            - Return true if a servo is attached.
 * detach()              - Stop an attached servo from pulsing its i/o pin.
